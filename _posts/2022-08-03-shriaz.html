<p>
    While the origins of the Shiraz grape are debated, with some saying the vine traces back to the town of Shiraz in Iran,
    the cradle of the Shiraz wine we love today is the Rhône Valley. The production of the Shiraz grape in this region dates
    back to the Medieval period but was popularised further in the 19th century when exported to Australia, where the
    development of Syrah (of the same grape variety) increased, producing subtle but brilliantly bold and intensely fruity
    reds.
</p>

<p>
    The Syrah grape has become internationally renowned and is very popular with wine producers across Italy, from Tuscany
    to Sicily. It is more often cultivated in central and southern Italy, producing better results in warmer regions.
</p>

<h2>Flavours, Taste & Texture</h2>

<p>
    Syrah wines simulate flavours from pepper, spice and sweet red fruit.
    With its rich soil, proximity to Lake Trasimeno and ideal temperate ranges, one of the stand-out Italian Syrah regions
    is the Cortana. These intense but elegant reds compete with the best of Syrah worldwide and have great ageing potential. 
</p>

<p>
    Syrah can produce complex wines capable of ageing and improving over many decades. In the vintage versions of Syrah, the
    deep reds also contain purple-red nuances, which often become more spiced with age, while younger Syrahs can be more
    floral and fruitier.
</p>


<h2>How long to age and blend with other grape varieties</h2>
<p>
    Syrah is an extremely useful blending grape. Due to its front-loaded style, Syrah is often blended with grapes that add more mid-palate, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, to help make the wine taste more complete. 
</p>
<p>
    In the southern Rhône, it is common for Syrah to be blended with any combination of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Carignan and Cinsault, among others, whilst in the New World regions of Australia and California, Syrah-Viognier blends are an increasingly common combination.
</p>
<p>
    In Italy, the 'Supertuscan' wines are shaking up the wine establishment. Coined in the 1980s, this is the term used to
    describe Tuscan red blends which used grapes not native to Italy, including the Syrah, but also Merlot and Cabernet
    Sauvignon. 
</p>
<p>
    This has continued to grow in popularity beyond Tuscany, with many Sicilian wines also producing similar
    blends to add body and elegance to their Syrah wines.

<h2>What foods to pair with</h2>

<p>
    The adage of what grows together, goes together, certainly rings true for Italian Syrah wines, pairing well with Tuscan and Sicilian cuisine in particular. The spice of Syrah pairs best with foods that are robust and flavourful which all work well with the medium to high tannins of Syrah.
</p>



<p>
    As with any pairing, it is best to match the wine's weight and flavour intensity with that of the food. The boldness of a Syrah would overpower delicate cheese flavours, so it is best to go for strong flavours, like blue cheeses, or if you're looking for Italian cheese, a Val di Chiana works perfectly.
