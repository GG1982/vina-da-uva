<p>
    With over 200 varieties, Muscat (Known as Moscato in Italy, Moscatel in Spain, and Portugal) is one of the oldest and
    most popular grape families worldwide. 
</p>
<p>

    Mostly used to produce white wines, these varieties are famous for their perfumed
    aromatic qualities, ranging from blossomy and floral to musky and grapey.
</p>

<p>
    The Moscato grape belongs to the Moscati family of grapes, whose name originates from the museum (moss in Latin), for
    their characteristic aroma found in the grapes. Some varieties include Moscato di Alessandria, known for its fruity and
    light white wines. 
</p>
<p>
    
    Moscato Ottonel is a paler colour and ripened earlier, while the Moscato d'Amburgo is a black grape
    variety and a table wine.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, the Moscato Giallo (yellow) and Moscato Rosa (pink) from northern Italy are usually used to make a range of dry
    and sweet wines. Moscato generally prefers warm climates such as the Mediterranean.
</p>

<h2>Flavours, Taste & Texture</h2>

<p>
    Famous for its sweet flavours of peaches and orange blossoms, Moscato is made up of perfumed aromas of ripe pear,
    mandarin orange, sweet Meyer lemon, honeysuckle, and orange blossom. 
</p>
<p>

    The grape has a unique floral aroma known as
    linalool found in citrus flowers, mint, and cinnamon.
    Due to Moscato's distinctive aroma, it is a great option for winemakers due to its versatility for making varieties of
    sweet, dry, medium, sparkling or dessert wines.
</p>

<p>
    Sparkling Moscato wines are usually sweeter and can have a zesty and
    spritz taste.
    When poured into a glass, white wine Moscato has a fizzy texture but is not as bubbly as sparkling wines. Moscato is a
    perfumed grape variety but keeps its grapey quality.
</p>


<h2>How long to age and blend with other grape varieties</h2>
<p>
    Moscato wine generally does not take long to produce. It requires 12 days of clearing, and the winemaker will decide the
    style they are aiming for. It has a lower acidity, thanks to higher levels of residual sugar, giving it a slight
    sweetness. They do not require expensive barrels or long ageing storage costs.
</p>
