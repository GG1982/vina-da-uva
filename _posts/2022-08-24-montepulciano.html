<p>
    Montepulciano is a dry red wine grape grown widely in central Italy. The most commons regions being Abruzzo, Marche,
    Molise, Umbria and Puglia. 
</p>
<p>
    Despite being widely planted throughout central Italy, the Montepulciano grape is not grown
    in the vineyards around the actual town of Montepulciano itself.
</p>

<p>
    The most well-known region in which it is grown in Abruzzo. Hence many wines from the region are labelled Montepulciano
    d'Abruzzo. 
</p>
<p>
    Montepulciano is the 2nd most planted red grape in Italy after Sangiovese and has had a reputation for being
    one of the most reasonably priced red wines.
</p>

<p>
    The Montepulciano grape is widely available in 20 of Italy's 95 provinces and is a required grape in several
    denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) red wines. 
</p>

<p>
    Some of the more well know Montepulciano DOCs are wines such as
    Montepulciano d'Abruzzo in Abruzzi, Offida Rosso Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) and Rosso
    Piceno in Marche.
</p>

<p>
    Outside of Italy, vineyards in the USA and Australia contribute to about 1% of Montepulciano wines. However, they are
    more on the experimental side instead of the classic wines from Italy.
</p>




<h2>Flavours, Taste & Texture</h2>
<p>
    Despite its darkness, Montepulciano wines taste fruity red flavours such as cherries, cranberry and red plum. In better
    quality-aged Montepulciano wines, you can expect to taste more herbal notes such as oregano and savoury notes such as
    tobacco.
</p>

<p>
    The more the wine is aged, the more fruit flavours develop to tones of black fruit, such as prune, blackberry, and
    boysenberry. 

</p>
<p>
    The Montepulciano grape variety typically produces a medium-bodied red wine and is often easy to drink
    alongside food, particularly the younger fruitier wines.
</p>

<p>
    Whilst the wine is generally a deep purple colour, it provides a slightly rustic sense and feels, while the tannins
    remain pleasantly soft. 
</p>

<p>
    The longer the wine is aged, the more complex the flavours are, with some of the best examples
    of Montepulciano wine being at least four or five years.
</p>


<h2>How long to age/winemaking and blend with other grape varieties?</h2>

<p>There are generally two ways of ageing Montepulciano wine:</p>


<ol>
    <li>
        In small oak barrels or casks for the high-quality varieties.
    </li>
    <li>
        In stainless steel barrels for more table wines.
    </li>

</ol>

<p>
    Montepulciano oak-aged wines are known for their rich, deep flavours and strong tannic presences. They are given at
    least four years for better taste. Below are the varieties of different blends of Montepulciano grapes.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>

    </li>
