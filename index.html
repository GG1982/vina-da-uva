            <p>Montepulciano wines are famous for their soft flavours and deep colour pigments. Delicate tannins and a low acidity
            create a wine typically best consumed soon after bottling.</p>

            <p>
                Sangiovese wine is known for its high acidity, medium-plus tannins and savoury characters. Sniff a glass next time
                you'll find that aromas move toward dried cherries, figs and roses

            <p>Syrah or shiraz can produce delicously dark wine. Its high tannins means shiraz wines are capable of aging and improving
            over the decades. Expect rich, deep flavour of dark fruits and hint of coffee and spice.</p>

                Trebbiano d'Abruzzo is a white wine full of colour, sweet scents, duration of flavour and capability to age. In the
                right hands, the trebbiano grapes results in some of the finest white wines avaliavlible.
