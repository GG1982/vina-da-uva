            <p>
                Montepulciano wines are famous for their soft flavours and deep colour pigments. Delicate tannins and a low acidity
                create a wine typically best consumed soon after bottling.

            <p>
                Sangiovese wine is known for its high acidity, medium-plus tannins and savoury characters. Sniff a glass next time
                you'll find that aromas move toward dried cherries, figs and roses.

            <p>
                Syrah or shiraz can produce delicously dark wine. Its high tannins means shiraz wines are capable of aging and improving
                over the decades. Expect rich, deep flavour of dark fruits and hint of coffee and spice.

            <p>
                Merlot's soft texture helps to give it a deliciously plummy, almost fruitcake-like flavour. It can be a little grassy
                and develops blackcurrant, blackberry, blueberry, chocolate and spice-like characters when fully ripe.

                The wine made from Moscato has an irresistible sweetness and refreshing fruit flavors! Most Moscato wines have high
                residual sugar levels, an opulent floral aroma with hints of honeysuckle, and flavor notes of white peach, apricot, and
                tropical fruit.
